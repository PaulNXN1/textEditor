# textEditor  üíª

Module 19 Assignment from UPENN Full Stack Coding Bootcamp!

Working with Progressive Web Application [PWA] coding. 

## Description

Module 19 was an assignment that tasked the developer to finalize coding for a text editor application that meets PWA criteria.  For example, the application will have "data persistence techniques" implemented in case one of the options is not supported by the browser **and** will be able to work offline, which is captured in the video attached to this README file.  


## Code Contributors

This project was completed by each individual student.  
Please note, the students were provided with some code pre-written by the UPENN staff.  

## User Story

Written for reference from UPENN Module 19 Assignment for the students:

"AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use"


## Acceptance Criteria 

The acceptance criteria focuses on meeting PWA requirements.  Once the coding is complete, each student was tasked to run the application via Heroku [link to application deployment below].
