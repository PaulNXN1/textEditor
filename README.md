# textEditor  üíª

Module 19 Assignment from UPENN Full Stack Coding Bootcamp!

Working with Progressive Web Application [PWA] coding. 

## Description

Module 19 was an assignment that tasked the developer to finalize coding for a text editor application that meets PWA criteria.  For example, the application will have "data persistence techniques" implemented in case one of the options is not supported by the browser **and** will be able to work on and offline, which is captured in the video attached to this README file.  


## Code Contributors

This project was completed by each individual student.  
Please note, the students were provided with some code pre-written by the UPENN staff.  

## User Story üìò

Written for reference from UPENN Module 19 Assignment for the students:

"AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use"


## Acceptance Criteria 

The acceptance criteria focuses on meeting PWA requirements.  Once the coding was complete, each student was tasked to run the application via Heroku [link to application deployment below].  

The main point of focus was confirming the application still worked storing data offline, which is an essential ability for mobile application development.  Once the user clicks and types in the text editor both on and offline, the user will be able to see the data saved in an object with IndexedDB.  After closing and reopening the application, the data is still available to the user [shown in the video].
